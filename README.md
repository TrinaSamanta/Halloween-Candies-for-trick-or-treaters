# Halloween-Candies-for-trick-or-treaters 🎃 #MavenHalloweenChallenge - Power BI Dashboard 🕸️

# Overview the Dataset:

In 2017, Walt Hickey from FiveThirthyEight set out to find the Halloween candy most people prefer. To figure it out, he set up an experiment in which online voters could select their favorite candy from randomly generated matchups (for example, Twix or Snickers?).
After compiling about 269,000 votes from 8,371 different IP addresses, Walt calculated the win percentage for each type of candy and included several key attributes (for example, does it contain chocolate?) to find what makes them popular.

- competitorname: The name of the candy
- chocolate: Does it contain chocolate?
- fruity: Is it fruit flavored?
- caramel: Is there caramel in the candy?
- peanutalmondy: "Does it contain peanuts
- nougat: Does it contain nougat?
- crispedricewafer: "Does it contain crisped rice
- hard: Is it a hard candy?
- bar: Is it a candy bar?
- pluribus: Is it one of many candies in a bag or box?
